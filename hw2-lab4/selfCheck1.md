# Self Check 1 (p87)

### 1) Big-Os of for loops
1. O(N<sup>2</sup>) since two nested for loops
2. O(N) since second nested for loop on runs twice per outer for loop or O(2N)
3. O(N<sup>2</sup>) since inside loop runs from N times and outer runs N times
4. O(N<sup>2</sup>) since inside loop will only run half over the entire run, however it still increases wth N so O(N<sup>2</sup>/2)
